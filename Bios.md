***Rachel Liu***

***Rachel Pring***: I am a fourth-year student at the University of Waterloo in the School of Planning. I recieved an Esri Young Scholar's Scholarship in 2023 for a project I led examining the resiliency of Nova Scotia road networks in hurricane conditions. I am interested in accessibility and climate change planning, expecially with regard to the Atlantic Provinces. 

***Matthew Woodward***: I am a second-year student at the University of Waterloo majoring in Geography and Environmental Management. I was a gold medalist at the International Geography Olympiad, placing eighteenth in the world in 2022. I am interested in natural disasters and using GIS to address their impacts. This interest was reflected in my work for the Northern Tornadoes Project last summer. In my free time, I enjoy following the Montreal Canadiens and hiking.
