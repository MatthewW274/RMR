***Matthew Woodward***: I am a second-year student at the University of Waterloo majoring in Geography and Environmental Management. I was a gold medalist at the International Geography Olympiad, placing eighteenth in the world in 2022. I am interested in natural disasters and using GIS to address their impacts. This interest was reflected in my work for the Northern Tornadoes Project last summer. In my free time, I enjoy following the Montreal Canadiens and hiking.
