# Re.Place: find and focus on where your city's infrastructure needs work
Team: Rachel Liu, Rachel Pring, and Matthew Woodward
## Mission Statement
With urban areas ever-expanding in our country and people generally moving to suburban areas, inner-city neighbourhoods are often left neglected in terms of the quality of their infrastructure. Potholes, broken wires, and lead pipes often plague these areas residents, leading to a decrease in day to day wellbeing. This leads to an overall decrease in quality of life for the people living here as they are subject to power outages, lower quality roads, and water issues at a greater rate than those living in the suburbs. 

This is where Re.Place comes in. Re.Place is a collection of web apps, citizen science surveys, and GIS analyses that aim to bring awareness to infrastructure decline in inner cities. The objective is for the data collected from this app to be used by policy makers in these cities to determine where to focus their efforts on infrastructure repair
## The Re.Place Collection
### Infrastructure Damage Reporting Survey
Collects community damage reports and creates a layer with the locations and descriptions of each damage report
### Re.Place App
### Re.Place Infrastructure Risk Analysis Layer
Displays a likelihood of infrastructure damage for certain areas based on infrastructure age in that area. This layer uses a js to display a tesselation for the likelihood of infrastructure damage, while taking into account the age of pipes, powerlines, buildings, and roads as well as the concentration of bus stops and routes. You can find the code in the ____ file in our GitHub.
