# Re.Place: find and focus on where your city's infrastructure needs work
Team: Rachel Liu, Rachel Pring, and Matthew Woodward
## Mission Statement
With urban areas ever-expanding in our country and people generally moving to suburban areas, inner-city neighbourhoods are often left neglected in terms of the quality of their infrastructure. Potholes, broken wires, and lead pipes often plague these areas residents, leading to a decrease in day-to-day wellbeing. This leads to an overall decrease in quality of life for the people living here as they are subject to power outages, lower quality roads, and water issues at a greater rate than those living in the suburbs. 

This is where Re.Place comes in. Re.Place is a collection of web apps, citizen science surveys, and GIS analyses that aim to bring awareness to infrastructure decline in inner cities. The objective is for the data collected from this app to be used by policy makers in these cities to determine where to focus their efforts on infrastructure repair.
## The Re.Place Collection
### Infrastructure Damage Reporting Survey
Collects community damage reports and creates a layer with the locations and descriptions of each damage report.
### Re.Place App
The Re.Place app displays a number of infrastructure reference layers along with infrastructure damage points from the damage reporting survey, and a heat map of where those points are located in the community. The Re.Place app also show the infrastructure risk analysis layer outlined below. This app acts as an all-in-one solution for displaying both infrastructure damage reports and risk for neighbourhoods to be subject to infrastructure damage.
### Re.Place Infrastructure Risk Analysis Layer
This layer displays the risk level for areas in Kitchener through sectioning the city into a hexagonal tessellation based on the average age of buildings present in the area as well as the number of water main leaks that have occurred in the past.
